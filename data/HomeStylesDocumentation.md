These definitions were provided by Steven Schwoerer in an email from the City Assessor's office.

* **Ranch** - A one story residence that does not have any usable half story or attic area. Usable attic area means attic area that could be converted to living area without raising the ridgeline. These are generally single-family residences built after 1934. A two unit, side-by-side ranch, without an attic, will be classed as a DUPLEX O/S (Style 11) or DUPLEX N/S (Style 12) based on age. If there is a usable attic present, the dwelling will then be called "04 CAPE COD." A building originally constructed as a ranch and with a partial second story addition or raising of the roofline over part of the building must have the style changed.

* **Bi-Level** - A bi-level or raised ranch is basically a one dwelling unit building with two level, one unit, design with the lower level approximately one-half above grade and the two levels split by a foyer at grade level (figure 22). A Bi-level must be listed as ONE STORY and FULL BASEMENT and have finished basement living area greater than zero.

* **Split-Level** - A split-level may also be called a tri-level or four level, this is a three or four level design distinguished by its irregular wall heights and different roof elevations. A tri-level must be listed as ONE STORY and PART BASEMENT with a first story area that is equal to the combined size of the upper levels, (2nd and 3rd); have finished basement living area greater than zero (0), and have only one living unit. A four level must be listed as ONE STORY and FULL BASEMENT with the first story area equal to the combined size of the upper levels (2 and 3) and have finished basement living area greater than zero.

* **Cape Cod** - A one story and attic or a one and one-half story residence that may have dog house dormers, extra gables, or shed dormers, was generally built after 1934, will be listed as cape cod style. Finished attic or half story area must be listed if the residence is to be listed as Cape Cod.  Dwellings classed as Cape Cod may only have one living unit.

* **Colonial** - A two or two and one-half story, single-family residence, generally built without an attic, will be considered as "Colonial."  Second floor area must be listed. Typically a Colonial has a living room, dining room, kitchen and half-bath on the 1st floor. A full bath and the bedrooms are usually located on the second floor and the stairway usually centrally located.

* **Tudor** - A single-family residence with one or more stories. Characteristics common to this style may include the following:

  * Masonry or masonry/frame

  * Steeply pitched gables

  * Arched windows and/or doorway

  * Entryway, one story usually with steep gable & may have curved roof line

  * Half-timber trim on gables and/or dormers

  * Exterior fireplace chimney frequently located in front & highly visible

  * Leaded glass

  * Ornamental stone trim around doors and/or windows

  Several of the above characteristics must be present to list the style as Tudor. Tudors are usually graded C+ or above.
 
 * **Townhouse** - A two or two and one-half story, side-by-side TWO UNIT residence will be considered a townhouse.  Second floor area must be listed. A townhouse under TWO separate key numbers will be listed as "07 Townhouse" with one (1) living unit. You should not list a ONE-story townhouse.
 
 * **Residence Old Style** - All single family residences generally built before 1935 and not qualifying as a Colonial (05), a Tudor (Style 06), a Mansion (Style 09), a Cottage (Style 10) or Milwaukee Bungalow (Style 18) will be classified as a Residence Old Style (ROS).
 
 * **Mansion** - Classic structure of Georgian, English, Renaissance, or Gothic architecture, usually built prior to 1930 of two or two and one-half stories. They were built using the highest quality materials of brick or cut stone.  These buildings have many specialty rooms including servants' quarters, libraries, and workrooms.  Common to these buildings are three or more baths, two or more fireplaces, and expansive entries with elaborate open stairways.  Most of these mansions are located in prestigious locations such as the Upper East Side and distinguished by their size of usually 4,000 to 8,000 square feet.  Grades have a range of A- to AA+.  Mansions may have more than one unit.
 
 * **Cottage** - Small, plain single family dwelling, usually one story, generally built before 1934, utilizes minimum construction standards ("economy") resulting in narrow boxy exterior appearance with little or no ornamentation, low pitch roof, few window openings, low basement wall height, simple floor plan with small rooms, minimal closet facilities and electrical outlets, softwood trim and often inadequate plumbing facilities for today's standard of living.  Cottages are usually graded "D" or less.

* **Duplex Old Style** - A two-unit residence built before 1945.  Each unit must have a separate entrance, kitchen, and generally separate full baths. 

* **Duplex New Style** - Any two-unit residence not qualifying as a townhouse, built in or after 1945. New Style Duplexes have separate entrances, kitchens and generally separate full baths.

* **Duplex Cottage** - Smaller 1, 1.5 or 2 story home with two living units, the lower unit often partially below ground level (usually basement); sometimes called "English Basement Cottages" or "Polish Flats"; minimal construction standards present (see "Cottage").

* **RM or Rooming House** - Any Residential parcel with more than one dwelling on the lot.  All dwellings on an "R/M" must be listed as STYLE 14. Each building must be listed separately. Example, if there are two dwellings on the parcel list the front building on card 01 of 02 and the rear building on card 02 of 02.

* **Triplex** - This is a residence currently usable as a three unit building and having three kitchens and separate bath facilities.  Buildings originally constructed with three units should be flagged with a "3" code in field 402.

* **Milwaukee Bungalow** - A SINGLE FAMILY residence generally characterized as having one and one-half stories or one story and attic generally constructed between 1915 and 1935. It can be further described as having "extra features" such as a bay at the front and side; rock face concrete block foundation walls; a gable or hip roof (Jerkin Head roof is common); boxed or exposed joist roof overhang; and a roofed porch with masonry piers across the front.

  Other features could include a sunroom, piano windows, artificial fireplace and  dining room with buffet or china cabinets. Not all of the above need to be present to be listed as a Milwaukee Bungalow.
    
* **Bungalow Duplex** - [JDJ note: a subsequent email clarified that BLDG_TYPE code 22 is "Bungalow Duplex," not "Bungalow Old Style" as listed in the MPROP documentation] A TWO FAMILY residence generally characterized as having one and one-half stories, or two stories, most with attics, generally constructed between 1915 and 1935.  The characteristics and extra features will be the same as shown for the ‘style 18 Milwaukee Bungalow’.  These would include a bay at the front and side; rock face concrete block foundation walls; a gable or hip roof (Jerkin Head roof is common); boxed or exposed joist roof overhang; and a roofed porch with masonry piers across the front.

  Other features could include sunrooms, piano windows, artificial fireplaces, and dining rooms with buffets or china cabinets.  Not all of the above need to be present to be listed as a Bungalow Duplex.  Some two story models may have two front doors and two stairways, while others have only one front door with a rear and/or side door.
